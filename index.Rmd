# Introduction
Throughout history, education is always a fundamental subject of nations worldwide since citizens' education attainment is closely related to people's economic and social life. Moreover, the level of educational attainment varies by country, race, and gender. In this project, we are interested in exploring various educational attainment levels in the United States and their influences on people's lives and decisions using the data collected by the US Census. To be more specific, we focus on the exploratory data analysis and data visualization on the data provided by the US Census to research how education attainment differ by gender, race, and states. We also explore the differences of people's earnings in the United States and females' marital as well as fertility status with different educational attainments. The purpose of our project is to let the readers have a comprehensive understanding of the educational attainment status in the United States and how pursuing higher education benefits people's earning and thus improve their social and economic life.
