Moreover, the level of educational attainment varies by country, race, and gender. In this project, we are interested in exploring various educational attainment levels in the United States and their influences on people’s lives and decisions using the data collected by the US Census. To be more specific, we focus on the exploratory data analysis and data visualization on the data provided by the US Census to research how education attainment differ by gender, race, and states. We also explore the differences of people’s earnings in the United States and females’ marital as well as fertility status with different educational attainments. The purpose of our project is to let the readers have a comprehensive understanding of the educational attainment status in the United States and how pursuing higher education benefits people’s earning and thus improve their social and economic life. "],["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data Sources", " Chapter 2 Data Sources Since both group members prefer to work on a data set that we are both interested in while having practical meaning simultaneously, we are all responsible for collecting the data. We first decide on some topics that we think might suit our final project and search for data set on this topic. After that, we compare data sets that we collect and finally decide to use the data on education attainment provided by the US Census. Data Source Link: https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?q=Education&amp;tid=ACSST1Y2019.S1501&amp;moe=false&amp;tp=false&amp;hidePreview=true https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?q=Education&amp;tid=ACSDT1Y2019.B13014&amp;moe=false&amp;tp=false&amp;hidePreview=false From the data source above, we divide the data that we collect into 5 data sets. The first data set called “2015-2019education” records the education attainment in the US from 2015 - 2019 and how education level differs by gender over these year. The second data set called “2015-2019earning” contains data on the median earnings of people in different education levels. The third dataset called “race” covers information on how the level education attainment in the United States is varied by race and gender within each race. The fourth data set call “states” contains data on education attainment and median earning differed by states. Finally the last data set called “births” has data on the education attainment of women from age 15 to 50 who gave birth and did not give birth in the last 12 months. The variables shown in those datasets in R after reading file and data transformation are (some variables may only appear in some of the data sets, and some variables may appear in all data sets): Year(numeric): Year from 2015 to 2019 Estimate(numeric): Number of people in particular category Earning(numeric): Median earning of the population in particular category Population(numeric): Population Education(char): Education attainment Gender(char): Gender Race(char): Race States(char): State names in the United States Give_birth(char): Whether a woman gives birth or not in the past 12 months Marriage(char): Marriage status. A problem with the data is that the original dataset is reader-friendly but not plotting-friendly using R. For example, the education attainment recorded in the data set may have different numbers of categories for race and the total population. To be more specific, there are five educational attainment levels for people aged 25 years or older, but there are two levels of education attainment reported when we want to focus on races to see how education attainment differs by race. To fix it, we need to split the original file into separate datasets and conduct data transformation to combine or split data to build data frames that are user-friendly in R. Please see the next section of data transformation to understand how data is clean and organized. "],["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data Transformation", " Chapter 3 Data Transformation The data sets that we gained from the official census website are in the forms of csv files before the transformation. Because of the unique characteristic of the census data, which are all count values with long descriptions, we primarily focus on transforming and pre-processing the data set into the version that we could apply in visualizing and analysis. It mainly contains the following steps: Read csv files as dataframes Transform the ‘messy’ data set into a ‘tidy’ one Formalize and abbreviate the categorical values Combine some groups (with relatively few frequencies) into one group Let’s use one of our data sets, ‘states’ as an example. After we read the csv files into data frame in R and extract the columns that we primarily focus on, the data contains multiple columns indicating education levels, with long and complicated names. Table 3.1: Column Names of State Education Dataset Column Names State Total Less.than.high.school.graduate High.school.graduate..includes.equivalency. Some.college.or.associate.s.degree Bachelor.s.degree Graduate.or.professional.degree To have a tidy data set, we transform those columns indicating the education levels into one column: State Education Population Alabama Total 3360058 Alabama Less.than.high.school.graduate 433073 Alabama High.school.graduate..includes.equivalency. 1039241 However, as we can see from the above subset of the dataset, some values in the ‘Education’ columns are long and complicated. It might create some issues for the following data visualization. Therefore, we abbreviate those values into shorter names. Their full names are indicated in the footnote of each graph using those abbreviations for clarification purpose. The above step 1-3 are repeated for each data set we use. For some data sets containing multiple categories, some of which have relatively low frequencies, we combine those categories as one group. For instance, in the data set counting the number of people with different education attainments in various races, we combine the race groups like ‘Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander alone’, ‘American Indian or Alaska Native alone’, and other race groups into one big group called ‘Other’. "],["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values", " Chapter 4 Missing values There are no missing values in the original data sets because we gain the population counts with different education attainments and other backgrounds instead of the case data set. While we are dealing with data on different education attainment levels by states in the United States, we need to convert the states’ names to their abbreviate. However, the R package usdata would convert Puerto Rico to NA. Since Puerto Rico is an unincorporated territory of the United States but not strictly a state in the United States, we decide to remove the data related to Puerto Rico to plot spatial data in a US map. "],["results.html", "Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Education Attainment and Gender in 2019 5.2 Different Levels of Education Attainment by Race 5.3 Different Levels of Education Attainment by Race and Gender Together 5.4 Median Earning for each Level of Education Attainment and Gender 5.5 Education Attainment and Women’s Marital and Fertility Status 5.6 Education Attainment and Median Earning by States", " Chapter 5 Results In this section, we look at data on the different levels of education attainment by gender, race, states and the possible influence of educational attainment on median earnings of the population and women’s marriage and fertility status in 2019 in the United States. 5.1 Education Attainment and Gender in 2019 We first focus on the level of educational attainment and how it differed by gender in 2019. We plot a mosaic plot to show the relation between these two variables. Notice that since the variable Education has five levels and long names, it is hard to display them appropriately and clearly in the label of mosaic plot. Therefore, we abbreviate the variable names by converting “Less than High School” to “&lt;HS”, “High School Graduate” to “HSG”, “Some College or Associate Degree” to “SC”, “Bachelor Degree” to “BD”,“Advanced Degree” to “AD”. From the mosaic plot, we can first observe that over the United States, people have high school graduate degree and some college or associate degree occupy the two largest proportions of the whole population and people who do not go to high school or obtain advanced degrees (graduate or professional degrees), occupy the two smallest proportions. Moreover, let us explore more about the relationship between gender and education. We can observe that more females generally obtain a higher level of education than males since in the group of less than higher school and high school, female occupy a smaller proportion than male, while in the group of some college or associate degree, bachelor’s degree, or advanced degree, female occupy a larger proportion than male. However, if we look at the whole population, approximately more than 85% of the population have graduated from high school, which is relatively high. 5.2 Different Levels of Education Attainment by Race Now, let us look at the different levels of education attainment by race in the United States. Unlike the previous plot, in this plot, educational attainment levels are “Higher School or Higher” and “Bachelor Degree or Higher”, which represent people with a high school graduate or higher degree and people with a bachelor or higher degree, respectively. From the above group bar chart, we can observe that White people, who occupy the largest population in the United States, have the highest percentage of people with a high school diploma or higher degree than other races, followed by Asian Americans and Black people. Hispanic or Latino people have the lowest percentage of people with higher educational attainment than other races. Moreover, if we look at the Asian American group, we can notice that in general, Asian Americans have high education attainment with both a relatively high rate of high school graduate or higher and the highest rate of bachelor degree or higher among all races. 5.3 Different Levels of Education Attainment by Race and Gender Together In this section, we look at how educational attainment levels vary by gender for each race by plotting a horizontal stacked bar chart faceted by 2 educational levels, namely higher school graduate or higher and bachelor’s degree or higher. One interesting finding from the above horizontal stacked bar chart is that more than 50% of the population who obtain a high school diploma or higher or a bachelor’s degree or higher are females. This unbalanced proportion of educational attainment within gender becomes even more apparent when we focus only on the plot of Bachelor Degree or Higher or only focus on black people. In general, the proportion of females among all population who obtain a high school or higher degree is larger than the proportion of males, and this difference becomes larger when it goes to the group of people with a bachelor’s degree or higher. Moreover, among all races, the contrast in the percentages of black females and black males among all black people who obtain higher educational attainments are the largest. Besides, the two proportional breakdowns of gender remain almost unchanged for white people and Asian Americans with a high school diploma or higher and with a bachelor’s degree or higher. 5.4 Median Earning for each Level of Education Attainment and Gender After exploring the proportional breakdown of education attainment by gender and race, we now focus on the possible influences of different educational attainment levels. In this section, we use bar chart faceted by gender to show how the median earning differs in population with different education attainments and how these differences appear in genders. We can observe from the plot that people’s earnings increase as they obtain higher degrees of education. Moreover, we can find that for all genders and the total population, median earnings for people who obtain bachelor’s degrees or higher are higher than the overall median earning for all populations. If we explore more on the bars’ lengths, we can observe a considerable increase in earnings for people obtaining bachelor’s degrees compared to those attending some colleges. The earnings for people with advanced degrees increase even more. This finding reveals the positive influence of higher education on people’s earnings and the high return rate of higher education investment regarding future earning. If we look closer to genders, females’ median earnings are lower than males and the total population regardless of educational attainment levels. Males with advanced degrees, namely graduate or professional degree, have the highest median earnings, and females with education attainment that is less than high school earn at least among all groups. 5.5 Education Attainment and Women’s Marital and Fertility Status In the last section, we notice that though high education attainment increases people’s earnings, the earnings among males and females are unequal for all education attainment levels. To explore the influence of educational attainment on women’s lives, we use a new data set with information on marital status for women who give birth or not in 2019 in different education levels. Then, we plot a horizontal stacked bar chart to visualize women’s distribution with different marriage statuses, fertility statuses, and education levels. Women who finish high school or obtain some college degrees take up the largest proportion of the whole women population, so they still occupy the largest proportion of women who give birth or not. Moreover, the proportional breakdown of education attainment for women giving birth or not in 2019 remained unchanged for married women. However, the percentage of females that obtain some college degrees or higher is larger for unmarried women who do not give births than the one for females who give birth in 2019. One interesting finding is that for women who give birth to babies in 2019, the proportional breakdown of education attainment was different with various marital statuses. More than 50% of unmarried women who gave birth to babies in 2019 had a high school graduate degree or lower. However, approximately 75% of married women who gave birth to babies in 2019 had some college degrees or higher. From this, we can observe that educational attainment might be a factor of unmarried birth. 5.6 Education Attainment and Median Earning by States In this section, we conduct a linked micromap to see how education attainment and median earning differ in states in the United States in 2019 and explore the potential relationship among educational attainment, median earning, and states. To visualize the data, we plot a linked micromap, including a Cleveland dot plot for bachelor’s degree or higher rate for each state, a Cleveland dot plot for the median earning for the total population in each state, and a map indicating the state corresponding the dot in the Cleveland dot plot. Notice that both Cleveland dot plots are sorted by the rate of bachelor’s degree or higher for each state. Even though Washington D.C. is not a state in the United States, it is an essential factor to be considered. Therefore, we put it in the plot as well. ## [1] &quot;micromapST Ends&quot; From the plot, it is clear to notice that Washington DC has the highest bachelor’s degree or higher education attainment rate and also the highest median earnings. It is reasonable because it is the United States’ capital city with fewer population compared to other states. Therefore, we regard it as an outlier. Looking at the micromap on the left side of the plot, we can see that the states with better higher education attainment rates than the medium are generally locally on the East and West coast and the Northern part of the United States. The states with relatively low higher education rates are mostly located in the Central and Southern parts of the country. There is no significant positive linear relationship between higher education attainment rate and median earning for each state in the plot. It is reasonable because the medium earning of a state is affected by multiple factors, including policy, geographic location, resources, etc. However, we can still observe a slight trend of a higher median earning with a higher population rate with bachelor degrees or higher for states. There are two states, Alaska and Montana, which require further research. Alaska has a relatively low rate of population with bachelor’s degrees or higher compared to the medium. However, it has a higher median earning, close to $50,000, compared to states with similar or even greater higher education attainment rates. The contrast might be due to Alaska’s rich mineral resources, developed tourism, and relatively small population. In contrast, Montana has a great higher education attainment rates but low median earning, less than $40,000. Its median earning is lower than the ones for most other states. The reduction of natural resources, closure of miners, and late technology adoption are some possible reasons lying behind it. "],["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 6 Interactive component", " Chapter 6 Interactive component In this section, we use D3 to construct an interactive and animated line chart to show the percentage of each level of educational attainment over the total population. In the below interactive line chart, readers are free to plot the line chart of the change of percentage from 2015 to 2019 of their chosen education attainment levels. There are five levels to choose from: Less than High School, High School Graduate, Some College or Associate Degree, Bachelor Degree, and Graduate or Professional Degree. Each line is plotted from 2015 to 2019 animatedly to help the readers better detect the trend of percentage for each education level. Interactive Line Chart for Education Attainment from 2015 to 2019 Less than High School High School Graduate Some College or Associate Degree Bachelor’s Degree Graduate or Professional Degree From the above line chart, we can observe an overall improvement of educational attainment from 2015 to 2019 in the United States. Firstly, after selecting only the line representing the percentage of people who do not have a high school diploma over the total population, it is clear to see that the line goes down. Then we select two more educational attainment levels, High School Graduate and Some College or Associate Degree; we gain two “flat” lines with a slight trend of decreasing from 2015 to 2019. Together with the first line, it is easy to detect a decrease in the percentage of the population who do not have a bachelor’s degree or higher. Besides, selecting only the lines for the levels, Bachelor’s Degree and Advanced Degree, we can observe two approximately parallel lines going up. It indicates a large increase in the percentage of people who obtain a bachelor’s or higher degree. As a result, there is an overall improvement in educational attainment in the United States from 2015 to 2019. "],["conclustion.html", "Chapter 7 Conclustion", " Chapter 7 Conclustion Although our data sets gained from census official website provide us with reliable and summarized data, they also create a limitation for our data visualization. Since each data set from census contains essential information on the focused topic, they normally do not have a large number of variables in each data set. in order to fully explore our topic, we need to browse multiple data sets and collect the relevant information. However, because each data set is specific to one topic, the consistency of data among different data sets is hard to determined. This characteristic of our data source limits the amount of data with consistency and the interaction among multiple variables for our project. In the future, if we could gain more variables with corresponding counts related to education attainment, we could explore the current stage of education attainment in the United States further more. Besides, after observing the contrast between the proportion of female attaining higher education degrees and the median earning of female population in the United States, we would like to investigate further on the current education attainment stage of female and their median earnings with the interaction with more variables and/or factors. In general, even though the uniqueness of our source’s data type creates some limits and difficulties in the visualization process, it also gives us the chance of transforming those data into the form we want and applying the plotting techniques on count data. Moreover, the time-consuming procedure of exploring the data set that we are interested in and has reliability makes us realize the importance of data source in data visualization. Having an accurate and reliable data set is the key and cornerstone of data visualization and further processes. "]]
