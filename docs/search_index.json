Moreover, the level of education attainment may vary by country, race, and gender. In this project, we are interested in exploring the various level of education attainment in the United States and the influence on people’s life and decision by different education attainment using the data collected by US Census. To be more specific, we will focus on the exploratory data analysis and data visualization on the data provided by US Census to research on how education attainment differ by gender, race and states as well as how education attainment influences females’ choices of marriage status while giving birth and people’s earning in the United States. The purpose of our project is to let the readers have an comprehensive understanding of the education attainment status in the United States and how pursuing higher education benefits people’s earning and thus improve their social and economic life.

Because of the unique characteristic of the census data, which are all count values with long descriptions, we primarily focus on transforming and pre-processing the data set into the version that we could apply in visualizing and analysis. It mainly contains the following steps: Read csv files as dataframes Transform the ‘messy’ data set into a ‘tidy’ one Formalize and abbreviate the categorical values Combine some groups (with relatively few frequencies) into one group Let’s use one of our data sets, ‘states’ as an example. After we read the csv files into data frame in R and extract the columns that we primarily focus on, the data contains multiple columns indicating education levels, with long and complicated names. states &lt;- read.csv(&quot;./data/states.csv&quot;, na.strings = &quot;N/A&quot;) #extract columns for education attainment states_education &lt;- states[,1:7] ## [1] &quot;State&quot; ## [2] &quot;Total&quot; ## [3] &quot;Less.than.high.school.graduate&quot; ## [4] &quot;High.school.graduate..includes.equivalency.&quot; ## [5] &quot;Some.college.or.associate.s.degree&quot; ## [6] &quot;Bachelor.s.degree&quot; ## [7] &quot;Graduate.or.professional.degree&quot; To have a tidy data set, we transform those columns indicating the education levels into one column: states_education &lt;- states_education %&gt;% pivot_longer(cols =!State ,names_to = &quot;Education&quot;,values_to = &quot;Population&quot;) ## # A tibble: 5 x 3 ## State Education Population ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 Alabama Total 3360058 ## 2 Alabama Less.than.high.school.graduate 433073 ## 3 Alabama High.school.graduate..includes.equivalency. 1039241 ## 4 Alabama Some.college.or.associate.s.degree 1002387 ## 5 Alabama Bachelor.s.degree 547975 However, as we can see from the above subset of the dataset, some values in the ‘Education’ columns are long and complicated. It might create some issues for the following data visualization. Therefore, we abbreviate those values into shorter names. Their full names are indicated in the footnote of each graph using those abbreviations for clarification purpose. states_education &lt;- abbreviate(states_education,total = TRUE) head(states_education) ## # A tibble: 6 x 3 ## State Education Population ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 Alabama Total 3360058 ## 2 Alabama Less Than High School 433073 ## 3 Alabama High School Graduate 1039241 ## 4 Alabama Some Colleges 1002387 ## 5 Alabama Bachelor Degree 547975 ## 6 Alabama Advanced Degree 337382 The above Step 1-3 are repeated for each data set we use. For some data sets containing multiple categories, some of which have relativel low frequencies, we combine those categories as one group. For instance, in the data set counting the number of people with different education attainments in various races, we combine the race groups like ‘Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander alone’, ‘American Indian or Alaska Native alone’, and other race groups into one big group called ‘Other’.
